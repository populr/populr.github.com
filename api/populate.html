  <h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p><em>To use Populate, you must already have a Populr account with API access enabled. If you're 
a brand new Populr user, contact support@populr.me to get API access enabled on your account.</em>

<ol>
<li>Create an API template on Populr.me. For instructions on creating an API template, check out the <a href="http://developers.populr.me/api/index.html#creating-pops">"Creating and Publishing Pops"</a> section of the 
Populr API Documentation.</li>

<li>Visit the secure Populate dashboard at <a href="http://populate.populr.me/">populate.populr.me</a> and enter
your API key in the box provided. You can find your API key on your Populr Group Settings page.</li>

<img src="/assets/images/populate_1.png" style="margin:20px;">

<li>Click 'Continue'</li>

<li>On the left hand side, you'll see a list of your API templates. Choose an API template, and then choose one of the options
in the top bar. The tutorials below will walk you through how to create a web form for generating copies of your pop, or 
using a CSV spreadsheet to create and publish large numbers of pops.</li>

<h3>Generating Pops from a Web Form</h3>
<hr />
<p>
A pop form is a simple web form that is automatically generated by Populate based on the tags and
regions you've defined in your template on Populr. Let's say I have a Populr template for a birthday
party. It includes the tags {{Party Address}} and {{Party Name}}. It also includes an image asset
region that I've called 'Party Photos'. When I use the Populate app to generate a form, that form
will include areas for providing those three pieces of data.
</p>
<img src="/assets/images/populate_3.png" width="800" style="margin:20px;">
<p>
When you create a Pop Form, you'll need to select a delivery action. The available options are explained below:
</p>

<h4>Delivery Actions:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
  	<strong>Publish the Pop</strong>: When they've completed the form, a pop will be automatically created and
published. The user will be redirected to their new pop in the browser. If you check the email
delivery box, they will also receive a Populate-branded email with their pop's URL.
  </li>
  <li>
  	<strong>Invite to Clone</strong>: When they've completed the form, the user will be redirected to Populr, where
they can create an account and continue editing the pop in their own account. If you check the email
delivery box, they will also receive a Populate-branded email with a URL they can use to create a
Populr account and continue editing later.
	<p><em>Note: This method is designed for scenarios where you don't need to track what users do
with the pops they create. Once the user clones the pop they've created, you can't see changes that
are made or control how/when the pop is published.</em></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<strong>Invite to Collaborate</strong>: When they've completed the form, the user will be redirected to Populr,
where they can create an account to continue editing the pop in your account. If you check the email
delivery box, they will also receive a Populate-branded email with a URL they can use to create a
Populr account and continue editing later.
	<p><em>Note: This method is great if you want to allow users to edit their pops after they've
filled out the form, but you want to maintain ownership and publishing rights. Using this method,
users are able to customize their pages and add content, but they cannot publish or delete their
pages.</em></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h3>Generating Pops from a CSV File</h3>
<hr />

<ol>
	<li>
	Identify the fields that you want to customize in each of your pops. That could include the name
of a product, a person's name, pictures and documents, and more. Create an API template on Populr.me
and make sure it contains API template regions and API tags for each of these fields.
	</li>
	
	<li>
	Visit the Populate website and follow the instructions at the top of this guide to connect to
your account. Select your template from the sidebar and then choose "Bulk Import from CSSV" from the
top menu.
	</li>
	
<img src="/assets/images/populate_4.png" width="800" style="margin:20px;">

	<li>
	Click the "Download" button. Populate will look at the fields available in the template and
provide you with a CSV file you can fill in. It is important that the fields are in the correct
order, so you should always use the CSV file provided by Populate.
	</li>
	
	<li>
	Open the CSV file and take a look at the fields. You should have one field for each of the API
regions and tags in your pop. Add a row to the CSV file for each pop you want to create.
	</li>
	
<img src="/assets/images/populate_5.png">

	<li>
	If you'd like to place documents or images in your pops, the documents must be available on the
web already (though they may be on a server that is not publicized.) Place the file URL, or file
multiple URLs separated with commas, into the appropriate cell in the CSV file. Once Populate runs,
the files will be hosted securely at Populr and you can take down the copies you posted on the web.
	</li>
	
	<li>
	The "Recipient Email" and "Recipient Phone" fields are optional. Populate will only send emails
to your recipients if you check the "Pop Delivery" check box. The phone number is only used if
you're publishing pops with a password and choose the "Two Factor Authentication" option.
	</li>
	
	<li>
	Save your changes to the CSV file.
	</li>
	
	<li>
	On the Bulk Import page, click "Choose File" and select the CSV file you saved. Choose one of
the delivery actions (described above) and type your email address at the bottom of the form. You'll
receive an email with the results of your job after Populate has finished.
	</li>

	<li>
	Click "Process Job"
	</li>
</ol>

<h4>Processing Results</h4>
<p>
You will receive an email from Populate when your pops have been created. The email contains a link
to the CSV file you provided with two columns appended to the end. One for each pop's password, and
another for each pop's URL. Depending on the delivery action you chose, this might be the URL of the
published pop, or a URL a user could use to collaborate on or clone the pop.
</p>
<p>
If errors occurred while processing your pops, an error will be shown in the output CSV file. You
should remove the rows that were processed successfully, fix the issues that prevented the failed
pops from being generated, and run just those through Populate again.
</p>
