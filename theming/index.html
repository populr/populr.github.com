      <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      <p>
        The Populr theming engine is based on the awesome javascript templating 
        engine <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com" title="Handlebars">Handlebars.js</a>. 
        Before starting a Populr theme, you should visit the Handlebars website 
        and familiarize yourself with the syntax.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you are comfortable with Handlebars syntax, download the Populr Theme 
        Skeleton to get started with your own theme.

  <h2>Anatomy of a Theme</h2>
  <p>A Populr theme is divided up into two main sections:</p>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="span6">
      <h3>Regions</h3>
      <p>
        At it's core, a region is simply a container for assets. The magic happens 
        when defining what type of <strong>layout engine</strong> a region uses 
        to display those assets. We'll talk more about this in a bit.
    </div>
    <div class="span6">
      <h3>Assets</h3>
      <p>
        Assets are the heart of Populr. Each item of content in a Pop is one of 
        five asset types:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Text</li>
        <li>Image(s)</li>
        <li>Recorded Video(s)</li>
        <li>Document(s)</li>
        <li>Embed(s)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each asset in a Pop is rendered according to the region it resides in as 
        well as the size selected for the asset.
